# IST-ACOMP | Computer Architecture Labs
This repository contains the laboratory assignments and documentation for the Computer Architecture course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.

# Overview
In this course, we explore the fundamentals of computer architecture using the RISC-V instruction set architecture. The labs are implemented and simulated using the [Ripes simulator](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes), a powerful and user-friendly tool for RISC-V assembly programming.

# Labs
The labs are organized into separate folders, each representing a specific lab assignment. Each folder contains the necessary files and documentation for that particular lab.

- [Lab 1](Lab1/L1.pdf) - Introduction to Assembly Programming
- [Lab 2](Lab2/L2.pdf) - Artificial Neural Network in Assembly
- [Lab 3](Lab3/L3.pdf) - Understanding Assembly Routines and Parameter Passing Methods
- [Lab 4](Lab4/L4.pdf) - Analysis of a Pipelined Processor
- [Lab 5](Lab5/L5.pdf) - Cache Memory
